<h2 id="what-is-cinemachine">What is Cinemachine?</h2>
<p>Cinemachine is a suite of ‘smart’ procedural modules which allow you to define the shot and
they’ll dynamically follow your direction. Set up shots which track and compose motion in
realtime, like AI camera operators. The procedural nature makes them bug-resistant as they
always work to make the shot based on your direction. They’re great for gameplay, but they’re
also amazingly fast for cutscenes. Change an animation, a vehicle speed, ground terrain -
whatever - and Cinemachine will dynamically make the shot. You can use really telephoto
lenses and not have to update the cutscene if things change.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Cinemachine works out of the box with no dependencies other than Unity itself.<br />
Just install it and you’re ready to go.  It’s pure c-sharp, fully open-source, 
and the public API has complete XML documentation built right in.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Cinemachine has been in development over a number of years across multiple projects. We’ve
been designing camera systems for almost 20 years and have shipped millions of AAA titles
across numerous genres. The Cinemachine team has an award winning cinematographer and
a senior engineer with heavy math skills. Also, we love this stuff to bits.</p>

<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission with Cinemachine is to build an entirely unified camera system bridging
gameplay, cutscenes, from fully procedural cameras to entirely canned sequences and
everything in between.</p>

<h2 id="example-scenes">Example Scenes</h2>
<p>Please have a look at our example scenes. They are shipped with the package and can be imported
via Package Manager.</p>

<h2 id="forums">Forums</h2>
<p>We have a busy discussion area on the forums.
